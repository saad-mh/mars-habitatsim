"""Pinhole backprojection of the (image-space, first-frame-only) goal bbox into a
static world-frame goal position, so rollouts can log a per-frame distance-to-goal.

GoalSpec only ever carries a normalized bbox in the frame it was resolved from —
there is no separate goal actor in the sim to query a world position from. This
module anchors one by backprojecting the bbox center through the depth map of
that same frame, using the pinhole model and the yaw convention pose_integrator
already commits to (heading = (cos_yaw, sin_yaw) in the x-z plane).
