"""Discrete-direction VLA query.

Instead of letting the VLA choose a free continuous action (v_fwd, v_lat,
yaw_rate), this constrains it to a single categorical choice -- forward,
turn_left, or turn_right -- over the current frame with the goal/obstacle
semantic masks overlaid, then maps that choice onto a fixed Action. This is
additive: QwenVlaPolicy and qwen_client.drive_action still exist unchanged
for continuous-action use.
