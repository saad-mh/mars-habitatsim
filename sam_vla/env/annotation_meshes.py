# render terrain, which z-fights almost everywhere instead of rendering the
# semantic id (see sim_utils.register_semantic_mesh). Lifting the whole
# object clears that. habitat_env.get_full_observation renders these meshes
# only for the semantic pass (never the RGB pass, via sim_utils.set_objects_hidden),
# so this only has to survive z-fighting on the semantic camera -- not stay
# small enough to be an unnoticeable RGB artifact. Keep it as small as
# possible anyway: a larger lift shifts the mesh's projected 2D footprint
# under oblique-camera parallax, which can offset masks/bboxes from the true
# rock silhouette. Verify empirically (inspect the semantic buffer for
# z-fighting holes/speckle) before changing this value.
